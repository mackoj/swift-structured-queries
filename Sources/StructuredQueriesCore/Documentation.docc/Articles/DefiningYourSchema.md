# Defining your schema

Learn how to replicate your database's schema in first class Swift types 
using the `@Table` and `@Column` macros.

The library provides tools to model Swift data types that replicate your database's schema so that
you can use the static description of its properties to build type-safe queries. Typically the
schema of your app is defined first and foremost in your database, and then you define Swift types
that represent those database definitions.

### Defining a table

Suppose your database has a table defined with the following create statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "reminders" (
  "id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT",
  "title" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  "isCompleted" INTEGER DEFAULT 0
)
```

To define a Swift data type that represents this table, one can use the `@Table` macro:

```swift
@Table struct Reminder {
  let id: Int 
  var title = ""
  var isCompleted = false
}
```

Note that the struct's field names match the column tables of the table exactly. In order to support
property names that differ from the columns names, you can use the `@Column` macro. See the section
below, <doc:DefiningYourSchema#Customizing-a-table>,  for more information on how to customize your
data type.

With this table defined you immediately get access to the suite of tools the library provides to
build queries:

```swift
Reminder
  .where { !$0.isCompleted }
// SELECT
//   "reminders"."id",
//   "reminders"."title",
//   "reminders"."isCompleted"
// FROM "reminders"
// WHERE (NOT "reminders"."isCompleted")
```

### Customizing a table

Oftentimes we want our Swift data types to use a different naming convention than the tables and
columns in our database. It is common for tables and columns to use "snake case" naming, whereas
Swift is almost always written in "camel case." The library provides tools for you to define your
Swift data types exactly as you want, while still being adaptable to the schema of your database.

#### Table names

By default the `@Table` macro assumes that the name of your database table is the lowercased,
pluralized version of your data type's name. In order to lowercase and pluralize the type name the
library has some light inflection logic to come up with mostly reasonable results:

```swift
@Table struct Reminder {}
@Table struct Category {}
@Table struct Status {}
@Table struct RemindersList {}

Reminder.tableName       // "reminders"
Category.tableName       // "categories"
Status.tableName         // "statuses"
RemindersList.tableName  // "remindersLists"
```

However, many people prefer for their table names to be the _singular_ form of the noun, or they
prefer to use snake case instead of camel case. In such cases you can provide the `@Table` with a
string for the name of the table in the database:

```swift
@Table("reminder") struct Reminder {}
@Table("category") struct Category {}
@Table("status") struct Status {}
@Table("reminders_list") struct RemindersList {}

Reminder.tableName       // "reminder"
Category.tableName       // "category"
Status.tableName         // "status"
RemindersList.tableName  // "reminders_list"
```

#### Column names

Properties of Swift types often differ in formatting from the columns they represent in the 
database. Most often this is a different of snake case versus camelcase. In such situations you can
use the `@Column` macro to describe the name of the column as it exists in the database in order
to have your Swift data type represent the most pristine version of itself:

```swift
@Table struct Reminder {
  let id: Int 
  var title = ""
  @Column("is_completed")
  var isCompleted = false
}

Reminder.where { !$0.isCompleted }
// SELECT
//   "reminders"."id",
//   "reminders"."title",
//   "reminders"."is_completed"
// WHERE (NOT "reminders"."is_completed")
```

Here we get to continue using camel case `isCompleted` in Swift, as is customary, but the SQL
generated when writing queries will correctly use `"is_completed"`.

### Custom data types

There are many data types that do not have native support in SQLite. For these data types you must
define a conformance to ``QueryRepresentable`` and ``QueryBindable`` in order to translate values to
a format that SQLite does understand. The library comes with conformances to aid in representing
dates, UUIDs, and JSON, and you can define your own conformances for your own custom data types.

#### Dates

SQLite does not have a native data type, and instead has 3 different ways to represent dates:

  * Text column interpreted as ISO-8601-formatted string.
  * Int column interpreted as number of seconds since Unix epoch.
  * Double column interpreted as a Julian day (number of days since November 24, 4713 BC).

Because of this ambiguity, the `@Table` macro does not know what you intend when you define a data
type like this:

```swift
@Table struct Reminder {
  let id: Int
  var date: Date  // ðŸ›‘ 'Date' column requires a query representation
}
```

In order to make it explicit how you expect to turn a `Date` into a type that SQLite understands
(_i.e._ text, integer, or double) you can use the `@Column` macro with the `as:` argument. The
library comes with 3 strategies out the box to help, ``Foundation/Date/ISO8601Representation`` for
storing the date as a string, ``Foundation/Date/UnixTimeRepresentation`` for storing the date as an
integer, and ``Foundation/Date/JulianDayRepresentation`` for storing the date as a floating point
number.

Any of these representations can be used like so:

```swift
@Table struct Reminder {
  let id: Int
  @Column(as: Date.ISO8601Representation.self)
  var date: Date
}
```

#### UUID

<!-- TODO: finish -->

#### JSON

<!-- TODO: finish -->

#### RawRepresentable

<!-- TODO: finish -->

#### Primary key

It is possible to tell let the `@Table` macro know which property of your data type is the primary
key for the table in the database, and doing so unlocks new APIs for inserting, updating, and
deleting records. By default the `@Table` macro will assume any property named `id` is the
primary key, or you can explicitly specify it with the `primaryKey:` argument of the `@Column`
macro:

```swift
struct Book {
  @Column(primaryKey: true)
  let isbn: String 
  var title = ""
}
```

If the table has no primary key, but has an `id` column, one can explicitly opt out of the
macro's primary key functionality by specifying `primaryKey: false`:

```swift
@Column(primaryKey: false)
var id: String
```

See <doc:PrimaryKeyedTable> for more information on tables with primary keys.
